	<p style = "margin-top:6em;">I switched my major from Business to Interaction Design in my freshman year. I realized even though I did find a passion in marketing, I found a bigger passion in people in general.</p>

	<p>Not only do I enjoy talking to people, working with people, interacting with people, but also I love to know more in depth about them, understand them and serve them. I took a 400 level anthropology class and was absolutely amazed by how people as a same species can be so different from one another. I participated in research in HCDE departments and get to know more how people think and why they behave in certain way through group work and independent research. </p>

	<p>The experienced I have had in the past year have affirmed me that my passion lays more in creating products that are human-friendly in all ways. Hopefully in the future, I am able to use the knowledge and my diverse experience to create the products that can make people feel more satisfied with their life and themselves.</p>
